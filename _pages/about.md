Hello! I am `Eui-Cheol Shin`, currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the Paul Drude Institute. My primary interests focus on the theoretical understanding of `disordered states`, spanning topics from non-equilibrium dynamics to amorphous materials. I received my Ph.D. in Physics from KAIST, where my doctoral research centered on `DFT` studies of thermoelectric and triboelectric phenomena. Subsequently, at Samsung Display, I began investigating amorphous phase using `materials informatics` and `TDA`. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via the email address below.
